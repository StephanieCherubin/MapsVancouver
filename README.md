# MapsVancouver
This project is created with Tkinter. 
For this project I wanted to use maps to show the comparison. I want to show how this GUI could be used for statisticians, journalists, realtors, students...
It is unfinished. I will add captions to the maps so you can get more info on each map. I will consider removing the counter and use the button at the bottom to change to the next picture.
